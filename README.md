# Frog-in-the-Pan-Momentum-Analysis
I recreate the seminal study titled "Frog in the Pan: Continuous Information and Momentum," originally conducted by Zhi Da, Turan G. Bali, and Quan Wen. The study examines the concept of "information discreteness" as a proxy for the rate at which information is incorporated into asset prices, and its impact on momentum trading strategies.
